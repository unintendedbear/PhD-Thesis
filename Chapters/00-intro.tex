\section{Goals of this Thesis} %FERGU: esto es un p√°rrafo que describe el objetivo de la tesis.

\lettrine{T}{he} goal of this thesis is to develop a methodology of data preprocessing, behaviour analysis, and consequent rule creation in a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) context. This methodology proposes using a combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Soft Computing (SC) techniques over context information related to a user interacting with a device, making benefit of the feature of rule model creation in some of these techniques. Finally, this methodology will be used to help evolving an initial, simple, and fixed set of security rules into a new set of rules that will aid in the discovery of dangerous situations.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro:byod}

\lettrine{T}{he} fast pace of introduction of new technologies, including the so-called \textit{smart devices}, has led modern computing to move in a short period of time to smaller, more reliable, and faster devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. At the same time, the use people give them is more varied and, among others, has given birth to the form of use known as the ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD) concept or philosophy. Since its first appearance in research \cite{ballagas2004byod} as a way to name the interaction between people's devices and a public display, such as a piece of art or advertising, it has become a very popular practise, integrated into companies \cite{thomson2012byod} and even schools \cite{song2014bring}.

More precisely, in the corporate world the BYOD practice refers to allowing employees to use their personal laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices for work-related tasks, while not necessarily being in the workplace. This has many advantages \cite{singh2012byod}; among them it is worth to mention saving costs -- since the company saves money on high-priced devices that it would normally be required to purchase for their employees --, and increasing flexibility and worker productivity as employees will not be asked to haul around while on the road multiple devices to satisfy both their personal and work needs. Other advantages are tied to the increase of worker satisfaction, attracting the best candidates, and the increase of engagement in the workplace and after hours \cite{singh2012byod}.

It has, however, a big disadvantage concerning security, since potentially unsecured devices from unaware users might interact with important company assets. Clearly the uncontrolled access to internal networks by the personal devices, for which companies have control limits due to privacy concerns \cite{miller2012byod}, exposes the companies to security risks such as data leakage, improper decommissioning, phishing that is focused on a specifig group or company\footnote{Also known as \textit{spear phishing}.}, surveillance, and many others possible threats\cite{lennon2012changing}.

The main manufacturers of the mentioned devices have taken advantage of this BYOD trend and have released a number of commercial products to help companies adopting the philosophy. However, they all work based on a fixed, pre-defined set of security rules which they simply apply to certain user actions.

Therefore, the main issue in the adaptation to a BYOD scenario is to obtain a high level of security, while maintaining user privacy \cite{miller2012byod}. A combination of Soft Computing and Machine Learning techniques is proposed in this thesis as a solution able to propose new security rules, that is platform independent and open source, to help companies increasing security by incorporating the new rules to the existing set and discover new relations between the events that might cause a dangerous situation.

\section{Challenges in BYOD}
\label{sec:intro:challenges}

\lettrine{E}{ven} though the term BYOD is relatively recent, as it has been mostly in the corporate world, researchers have studied its strong and weak points. Among the parts that worth improvement, the most important for this thesis are the following:

\subsection{Context awareness}
\label{subsec:context}

% Problem:
Previous papers have commented on the issue of using quality data to obtain accurate and valuable extracted knowledge, which is specially difficult when dealing with datasets taken from real world problems, where the sensors cannot work properly at a certain time. To avoid this, researchers have advanced the state of the art in the precision of the devices. For instance, in \cite{rios2015mobile}, the authors focus on the importance of having an accurate measure of the location of the devices. Although their approach seems to encroach upon employees' privacy, they implemented a mobile information system for BYOD adaptation, and tested it in both Android and iOS devices. The authors concluded that the efficiency of their system, along with the possibilities of the hardware in the devices, results in a location
error of less than 50 meters with a 95\% confidence level. These promising results allow the companies to use the location of their employees to apply certain security policies.

% How can we benefit and how can we help
In our case, an accurate detection of the location could be used to obtain more information about the happening event, and that could increase the classification accuracy. At the same time, the extracted rules as a result from the methodology we propose in this thesis can help the company in indentifying certain locations as ``dangerous'' or ``safe''.

\subsection{User behaviour}
\label{subsec:behav}

% Problem:
Even not on purpose, the users of the system are considered the main hazard due to their ignorance about company security rules  \cite{Adams_users99}. They want to benefit from the BYOD philosophy, so that they can balance their private and work life, but they usually are not familiar with the Corporate Security Policy (CSP) of their company.  Actually, the employees have a natural tendency to comply with the security policies \cite{Sip_SecPriv07,Bulg_SecPol10,AlOmari_SecPol12}, and that good intention increases by educating or training them in information security awareness  \cite{Shaw_SecAware09}, and decreases applying too much sanctions when a misuse or abuse occurs \cite{Her_SecPol09}.

% How can we benefit and how can we help
Soft Computing techniques, such as data visualisation, can help in understanding the behaviour of the users and the risks it might carry. We propose the use of these techniques, among others to aid the CSO presenting conclusions to the company, also helping them to identify possible threats.

\subsection{User privacy}
\label{subsec:user_priv}

% Problem:
When monitoring a system for security purposes, the deeper the analysis is, the best chances of finding the threat we have. A BYOD scenario implies monitoring users own devices, having a direct impact on their privacy \cite{Miller12Privacy}. And what is more, the users are very concerned about their privacy, and when asked about installing ``monitoring software'', they are very mindful about it \cite{Miller12Privacy, ali2015analysis}. Most of the state of the art and commercial solutions for BYOD address this problem in different ways \cite{de2015corporate}, but are not transparent to the user.

% How can we benefit and how can we help
The need for developing transparent, open software is then crucial, so that the users have the opportunnity to know which data is being monitored and what use is given over that data. In addition, in this thesis we have proposed the extraction of new attributes from the initial, monitored ones, to keep the information they can give but maintaining the privacy.

\subsection{Platform independence}
\label{subsec:platf_ind}

% Problem: Different OSs, architectures...
The main manufacturers have also given their attention to this BYOD paradigm, and they have tried to propose solutions, but only for their platforms \cite{de2015corporate}. In some cases, the user even has to consider buying a new device if they want to be more secure.

% How can we benefit and how can we help
The methodology proposed in this thesis is a server-side solution that is platform independent and works with the data at hand.

\subsection{Open science}
\label{subsec:openS}

% I know i'm barely copying Pablo but here we can talk about not available datasets and their problems (privacy).
The lack of BYOD-related security databases is a hindrance for the proliferation of research in this field. This situation clearly exists due to privacy considerations. And even after anonymising the resulting dataset, one can still, in certain cases, identify a user of the company the data comes from by processing the data. If this principle cannot be guaranteed, the data should not be released \cite{boillat2014handbook}. Furthermore, the commercial products that exist in the market \cite{de2015corporate} are proprietary software and whatever techniques they might use to detect new threats cannot be used for research.

% How can we contribute to open science
However, with this thesis we wan to contribute to open science and the research on applications of Genetic Programing. The specific source code of the proposed methodology is available under a LGPL V3 License at \url{https://github.com/fergunet/GPRuleRefinement}.

\subsection{Applications}
\label{subsec:apps}

% About what are the researchers researching?
The interest in the research fields of ML and Data Mining (DM) has increased with the need to perform DM and knowledge extraction over huge amounts of data \cite{witten2016data}, in order to extract the necessary knowledge to classify incoming events. More precisely and inside ML, Genetic Programming (GP) has been used to create classification rules for security policies \cite{freitas2002data, DeFalco2002257, sec_policy_evolution_gp_08, pol_evol_gp_3_approaches_08}. The applications of DM and ML are diverse; DM over forensics data is crucial to detect malware \cite{Ma:2011:LDM:1961189.1961202, DeVel2001} and intruders in a system \cite{Jaswal2015} or unusual network traffic \cite{Shalaginov2017359}, DM and ML together are being widely applied over health data for disease detection \cite{Murdoch20131351}, and also to perform sentiment analysis \cite{Poria201445, Ravi201514} and human behaviour analysis \cite{Kosinski20135802}, to cite the most prolific.

\section{Objectives}                     
\label{sec:intro:objs}

\lettrine{T}{he} objectives this thesis tries to fulfil are the following:

\newcommand{\objectivescenarios}{To characterise the target environments and use cases as a basis for the development of the methodology as a solution.} 

\subsection*{Objective 1: \objectivescenarios}
\label{subsec:intro:obj:problems}

As it has been mentioned, the main problem is to be able to extract inference rules from past behaviour instances that might help the CSO in a BYOD environment in the definition and refinement of security policies that, eventually, classify an upcoming event or user action as permitted or not permitted.Before starting to look for the best techniques, it is fundamental that we determine the surroundings of the problem, as well as establish the metrics and limits to which we can consider that a solution is \textit{good}. This will be, thus, the first objective. 

To accomplish this objective, we have set a number of tasks, described as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To study the State of the Art from two points of view: state of the use of owning devices by the workforce, and solutions for BYOD found in the market with their advantages and disadvantages. This way we obtain the characterisation of the scenario in which we are going to work, what has been done, and what it is yet to be achieved.
	\item To propose the set of metrics that will validate a BYOD solution, based on the gathered information from the state of the art.
	\item To define the limits for each metric, so that we can establish measures while developing the methodology as a solution for BYOD.
\end{enumerate}

% The conclusion would be:
% We have described the target environment in which to deploy our methodology, including a study of the use cases. Also, we have defined the metrics for measuring the efficiency of a particular set of security rules. This way, we have established that a set of security rules must have a number of FP and FN of _.

\newcommand{\objectivedata}{To obtain the set of data and choose the best Soft Computing techniques for processing it.}

\subsection*{Objective 2: \objectivedata} 
\label{subsec:intro:obj:methodology}

Behavioural data, in the context or scenario that is defined for \textbf{Objective 1}, has a particular set of attributes that can be either numerical, boolean - true or false -, or categorical. When monitoring the context of an action performed in a device, the majority of the variables that can be obtained are categorical, meaning that the value they can take is a nominal category. That makes calculating the distance or the relations between instances more difficult, and therefore, the number of classification techniques that we can use is reduced. This is why there is a need for obtaining numerical attributes from the processing of the categorical ones. The tasks that we take on to fulfil this objective are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To enumerate the attributes that are going to be extracted from the environment.
	\item To propose classification metrics in order to better identify and group the attributes.
	\item To identify the problems of real world datasets and propose state of the art solutions.
	\item To develop a pre-processing methodology that includes dataset cleaning and data visualisation.
\end{enumerate}

% The conclusion would be:
% We have set which variables are of interest to use as input and the extra knowledge that can be derived from them. Additionally, the preprocessing phase has been defined, and we have detailed which techniques should be use in every case, depending on the data at hand.

\newcommand{\objectivetechniques}{To choose the Machine Learning techniques that suit best to the problem and allow to obtain the best values according to the metrics.}

\subsection*{Objective 3: \objectivetechniques}
\label{subsec:intro:obj:fwork} 

The last objective is to find the actual techniques that will obtain the security rules, but with the condition of satisfying the limits for the metrics defined in \textbf{Objective 1}. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To test different configurations or parameters in the algorithms so that we obtain the best values, according to what has been defined in \textbf{Objective 1}.
	\item To validate the complete methodology over real sets of data.
\end{enumerate}

% The conclusion would be:
% We have developed a methodology that works in the defined scenarios, obtaining rates of FP and FN of _. In addition, we have built a server tool to present rules to a CSO.
